### Hello there 👋

#### Software Development Student by day ☼ and Passionate Developer by night ☾

Walking a delicate path, resisting the quiet pull of my own darkness. Each day is a quiet defiance, a whisper of hope in the face of inner chaos...

- ❤️  Anchored by a partner who sees the light in me, even when I can’t.
- 🥼  Name: `NaerQAQ` / `2000000` / `QwQ-dev` / `Psyche`, these are all my names
- 🧠  Penning lines of code I often dismiss as unworthy, yet somehow, they feel like tiny steps forward.
- 🎮  Fan of the game `The Song of Saya`
- 🛠️  Owner of [Cloud Habitat Shop](https://qwqdev.shop/), Administrator of [HZ Shop](https://hzmod.ooo/), Working on LegacyLands(https://github.com/LegacyLands) for a long time.
